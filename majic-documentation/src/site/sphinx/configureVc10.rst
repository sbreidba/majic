installed gmake (and a bunch of other stuff) using GetGnuWin32 as
described at http://getgnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ . Simply 

   * install GetGnuWin32
   * run its ``download.bat``
   * run its ``install.bat``
   * put the gnuwin32\\bin folder in your path (I put it after git, so
     that we use git's bash program.)
